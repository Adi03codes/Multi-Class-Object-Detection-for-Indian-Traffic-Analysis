# Multi-Class-Object-Detection-for-Indian-Traffic-Analysis
 This project develops a deep learning-based multi-class object detection system tailored to Indian traffic scenarios. It detects and classifies diverse objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, potholes, and traffic signs in real-time to support AI-powered traffic management and mobility solutions.
